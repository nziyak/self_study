so, an automatic variable will destroyed when a block or region that a variable is  declared, 
defined and used and when that block or region ends

                          the content of outer block is visible to internal block but the content of outer block is not visible to internal block.
                          so we can use a variable which is defined in outer block in internal block. but we cant use a variable which is defined
                          in internal block in outer block.

                          we can summarize the scoping rule like that: content of a block is not visible outside of it. 

                          and a variable that declared in internal block -local of outer block- will be priority while been printing.
