
/*how to assign a character. btw, one character is one byte so 8 bit. 
   char some_character_name ='N' A char can hold one caharacter. because its one byte.
   And if you write, char some_character_name= 65. And print it, it will be printed as a character, not as a integer*/
   /*For example; to print 65 as a character, the code must be like that: 
   #include <stdio.h>
   int main(){

    char var = 65;
    printf("%c", var);  //*if you type %d it will print decimal.
    return 0;

   }*/

   /*difference between character and integer is that, character is capable of holding one byte of information at a time,
   on the other hand, integer is capable of holding either 2 or 4 bytes of info.*/
