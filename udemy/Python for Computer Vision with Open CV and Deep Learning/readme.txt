after downloading anaconda, run the command "conda env create -f cvcourse_linux.yml" in the directory which cvcourse_linux.yml is downloaded. with this, conda will create an virtual environment and install the required packages in it. all notebooks and python codes can be runned after installing requirements. if the "solving resources" step takes too long time, download mamba for speeding up the solving process.
